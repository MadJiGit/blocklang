    "p_2" : "Yes, we know that pain. We’re Bulgarian.\nAnd whenever we searched for something in Bulgarian, Google kept giving us results in Russian. Sure, the languages may sound similar — but the content was completely irrelevant. Just a waste of time.",
    "p_3" : "Or maybe this sounds familiar:\nYou search for news, and Google floods the page with clickbait sites and fake news?\nThat constant noise made it frustrating to find reliable, high-quality information.\nWe just wanted something simple and quiet — something that filters the junk without getting in the way.",
    "p_4" : "So we built a browser extension to solve our own problem.\nWe started with a Chrome version, just to test the idea. When we saw how well it worked, we brought it to Safari for macOS and iOS — for people like us who use Apple devices."

    "p_2" : "We’re Bulgarian — but Google kept thinking we wanted to read Russian. Thanks, Google, but нет.",
    "p_3" : "And let’s not even talk about the other mess.\nClickbait. Fake news. Sites that look like they were built in 2004 by a conspiracy theorist with a dial-up modem.\nAll we wanted was decent information. Instead, we got a circus.",
    "p_4" : "So we built our own solution: a browser extension that blocks the noise, filters the junk, and lets us actually find what we’re looking for.\nIt started as a little tool just for Chrome. It worked so well, we brought it to Safari on macOS and iOS — because hey, we like nice things too."
